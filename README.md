Chrome-extension to manage Google Apps Script(GAS) code with your favorite SCM service(github/github enterprise/bitbucket/gitlab).

With this extension, you can manage your code in GAS editor, push code to a new created branch, pull from a repository/branch.

The extension does not use the Google Drive API, so you don't need any google authentication. Moreover, this extension supports **Bound scripts**.

# **NOTICE**
5.0.0 **ONLYL** support the new IDE, with a extra Google login to access Apps Script Projects.

[IMPORTANT]Currently, the Google OAuth App used is still waiting for reviewing, before it complete, it only can allocate 100 users, so you may failed to grant permission to the extension. Please wait for the review complete(sadly Google said it takes 4~6 weeks), or install the extension from souce code to use an old version like v4.0.3, it should still work with the legacy IDE.

And before the review complete, there will be a warn page after you choose the Google account, please go ahead to allow the access otherwise the extension wonâ€™t work.
